# Simple_Rollers

This will simply be a collection point for my semi-automated "pen and paper" RPGs.
Using a set of rules, written elsewhere, these simple console programs and a little imagination, this can be used to play
simple RPGs with friends.

This will also serve as a defacto repo of certain functions for any code that I pick up.
